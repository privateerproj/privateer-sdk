      The project documentation MUST provide design documentation demonstrating
      all actions and actors within the system.
    objective: |
      Provide an overview of the project's design and architecture, illustrating
      the interactions and components of the system to help contributors and
      security reviewers understand the internal logic of the released software
      assets.

          When the project has made a release, the project documentation MUST
          include design documentation demonstrating all actions and actors
          within the system.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Include designs in the project documentation that explains the actions
          and actors. Actors include any subsystem or entity that can influence
          another segment in the system.
          Ensure this is updated for new features or breaking changes.

        recommendation: |
          Document all software interfaces (APIs) of the released software
          assets, explaining how users can interact with the software and what
          data is expected or produced.
          Ensure this is updated for new features or breaking changes.

      The project MUST assess the security posture of all software assets.
    objective: |
      Provide project maintainers an understanding of how the software can be
      misused or broken allows them to plan mitigations to close off the potential
      of those threats from occurring.

          When the project has made a release, the project MUST perform a
          security assessment to understand the most likely and impactful
          potential security problems that could occur within the software.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Performing a security assessment informs both project members as well
          as downstream consumers that the project understands what problems
          could arise within the software. Understanding what threats could be
          realized helps the project manage and address risk. This information
          is useful to downstream consumers to demonstrate the security acumen
          and practices of the project.
          Ensure this is updated for new features or breaking changes.

          When the project has made a release, the project MUST perform a threat
          modeling and attack surface analysis to understand and protect against
          attacks on critical code paths, functions, and interactions within the
          system.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Threat modeling is an activity where the project looks at the
          codebase, associated processes and infrastructure, interfaces, key
          components and "thinks like a hacker" and brainstorms how the system
          be be broken or compromised. Each identified threat is listed out so
          the project can then think about how to proactively avoid or close off
          any gaps/vulnerabilities that could arise.
          Ensure this is updated for new features or breaking changes.

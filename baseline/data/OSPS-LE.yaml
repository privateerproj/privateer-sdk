title: Legal
description: |
  Legal focuses on the policies and
  procedures that govern the project's licensing
  and intellectual property. These controls help
  ensure that the project's source code is
  distributed under a recognized and legally
  enforceable open source software license,
  reducing the risk of intellectual property
  disputes or licensing violations.

      The version control system MUST require all code contributors to assert
      that they are legally authorized to make the associated contributions
      on every commit.
    objective: |
      Ensure that code contributors are aware of and acknowledge their legal
      responsibility for the contributions they make to the project, reducing
      the risk of intellectual property disputes against the project.

          While active, the version control system MUST require all code
          contributors to assert that they are legally authorized to make the
          associated contributions on every commit.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Include a DCO in the project's repository, requiring code
          contributors to assert that they are legally authorized to commit the
          associated contributions on every commit. Use a status check to ensure
          the assertion is made. A CLA also satisfies this requirement.
          Some version control systems, such as GitHub, may include this in the
          platform terms of service.

          It is understood that projects with a lengthy history prior to
          adopting OSPS Baseline may not be able to retroactively enforce this
          requirement.

      All licenses for the project MUST meet the OSI Open Source Definition
      or the FSF Free Software Definition.
    objective: |
      Ensure that the project's source code is distributed under a recognized
      and legally enforceable open source software license, providing clarity on
      how the code can be used and shared by others.

        recommendation: |
          Add a LICENSE file to the project's repo with a license that is an
          approved license by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), or a free
          license as approved by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Examples of
          such licenses include the MIT, BSD 2-clause, BSD 3-clause revised,
          Apache 2.0, Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL), and the GNU
          General Public License (GPL). Releasing to the public domain meets
          this control if there are no other encumbrances such as patents.

          While active, the license for the released software assets MUST meet
          the OSI Open Source Definition or the FSF Free Software Definition.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 1
          - Maturity Level 2

        recommendation: |
          If a different license is included with released software assets,
          ensure it is an approved license by the Open Source Initiative (OSI),
          or a free license as approved by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
          Examples of such licenses include the MIT, BSD 2-clause, BSD 3-clause
          revised, Apache 2.0, Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL), and the
          GNU General Public License (GPL). Note that the license for the
          released software assets may be different than the source code.

    objective: |
      Ensure that the project's source code and released software assets are
      distributed with the appropriate license terms, making it clear to users
      and contributors how each can be used and shared.

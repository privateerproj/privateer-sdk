          When a commit is made to the primary branch, the project's version
          control system MUST require at least one non-author approval of the
          changes before merging.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Configure the project's version control system to require at least one
          non-author approval of changes before merging into the release or
          primary branch. This can be achieved by requiring a pull request to be
          reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor before it can
          be merged.

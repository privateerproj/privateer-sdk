          If an external source is used, ensure that the project documentation
          and contributing guide clearly and visibly explain how to use the
          reporting system. It is recommended that project documentation also
          sets expectations for how defects will be triaged and resolved.

      Enable users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the project's
      released software assets, reducing the risk of using tampered or
      unauthorized versions of the software.

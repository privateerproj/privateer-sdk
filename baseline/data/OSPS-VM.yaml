  Vulnerability Management focuses on the
  processes and practices used to identify and
  address security vulnerabilities in the project's
  software dependencies. These controls help ensure
  that the project is well positioned to respond to
  security threats and vulnerabilities in the software.

      The project MUST publish contacts and process for reporting
      vulnerabilities.
    objective: |
      Reports from researchers and users are an important source for identifying
      vulnerabilities in a project. People with vulnerabilities to report should
      have a clear understanding of the process so that they can quickly submit
      the report to the project.

          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Establish a VEX feed communicating the exploitability status of

          mitigations in place preventing vulnerable code from being
          executed.

      The project MUST enforce a policy for addressing SCA findings.
    objective: |
      Ensure that the project clearly communicates the threshold for remediation
      of SCA findings, including vulnerabilities and license issues in software
      dependencies.
      Ensure that violations of your SCA policy are addressed before software
      is merged as well as before it releases, reducing the risk of compromised
      delivery mechanisms or released software assets that are vulnerable or
      malicious.

          While active, the project documentation MUST include a policy that
          defines a threshold for remediation of SAST findings.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Document a policy in the project that defines a threshold for
          remediation of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) findings.
          Include the process for identifying, prioritizing, and remediating
          these findings.

          While active, all changes to the project's codebase MUST be
          automatically evaluated against a documented policy for security
          weaknesses and blocked in the event of violations except when declared
          and suppressed as non-exploitable.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Create a status check in the project's version control system that
          runs a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool on all changes
          to the codebase. Require that the status check passes before changes
          can be merged.

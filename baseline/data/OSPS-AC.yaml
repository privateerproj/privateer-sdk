title: Access Control
description: |
  Access Control focuses on the mechanisms and
  policies that control access to the project's version
  control system and CI/CD pipelines. These controls help
  ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive
  data, modify repository settings, or execute build and
  release processes.

    title: |
      The project's version control system MUST require multi-factor
      authentication for users modifying the project repository
      settings or accessing sensitive data.
    objective: |
      Reduce the risk of account compromise or insider threats by requiring
      multi-factor authentication for collaborators modifying the project
      repository settings or accessing sensitive data.

          When a user attempts to read or modify a sensitive resource in the project's
          authoritative repository, the system MUST require the user to complete
          a multi-factor authentication process.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 1
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Enforce multi-factor authentication for the project's version
          control system, requiring collaborators to provide a second form of
          authentication when accessing sensitive data or modifying repository
          settings. Passkeys are acceptable for this control.

      permissions to the lowest available privileges by default.
    objective: |
      Reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the project's repository by
      limiting the permissions granted to new collaborators.

          When a new collaborator is added, the version control system MUST
          require manual permission assignment, or restrict the collaborator
          permissions to the lowest available privileges by default.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 1
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Most public version control systems are configured in this manner.
          Ensure the project's version control system always assigns the lowest
          available permissions to collaborators by default when added, granting
          additional permissions only when necessary.

          When a direct commit is attempted on the project's primary branch,
          an enforcement mechanism MUST prevent the change from being applied.

          - Maturity Level 1
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          If the VCS is centralized, set branch protection on the primary branch
          in the project's VCS. Alternatively, use a decentralized approach,
          like the Linux kernel's, where changes are first proposed in another
          repository, and merging changes into the primary repository requires a
          specific separate act.

          When an attempt is made to delete the project's primary branch,
          the version control system MUST treat this as a sensitive activity
          and require explicit confirmation of intent.

          - Maturity Level 1
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Set branch protection on the primary branch in the project's version
          control system to prevent deletion.

      Reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the project's build and release
      processes by limiting the permissions granted to steps within the CI/CD
      pipelines.

          When a CI/CD task is executed with no permissions specified, the
          project's version control system MUST default to the lowest available
          permissions for all activities in the pipeline.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 2
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Configure the project's settings to assign the lowest available
          permissions to new pipelines by default, granting additional
          permissions only when necessary for specific tasks.

          When a job is assigned permissions in a CI/CD pipeline, the source
          code or configuration MUST only assign the minimum privileges
          necessary for the corresponding activity.
        applicability:
          - Maturity Level 3
        recommendation: |
          Configure the project's CI/CD pipelines to assign the lowest available
          permissions to users and services by default, elevating permissions
          only when necessary for specific tasks. In some version control
          systems, this may be possible at the organizational or repository
          level. If not, set permissions at the top level of the pipeline.
